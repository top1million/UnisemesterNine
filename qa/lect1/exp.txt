public static Vector_union(Vector a , Vector ){

}





before i write my testcases ,
the function has ambiguity ,
but we have to ask some questions ,
so we can understand the product in the good way,


to answer the archloch is saying
1)no duplicates
null is allowed
sortes yes
different length (unbounded)
test union function
