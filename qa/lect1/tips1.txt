index of array from zero
function name 

faliuare   ->     i am not sure what is the failure.
fault    ->       fault is that the i = 1
error    ->       internal state the changes during the runtime tha expected value doesnt equal the result




what is the difference between varification and validation:-

*) validation : i am doing the rigth thing
*) verification : i am doing the right thing right ( i am using the right techniques and the right methods ) 

for having maipulation on the arry i should know spaciification about the array , in this case when i use the array i am surely using the right spacifications of the array , in the right way .

verification is to make internal states , is working on the right way.


1)verification : is checking that the password has no special chars.
2)validation : its for output , the final product
